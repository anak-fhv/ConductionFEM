File to add todos for Conduction FEM.

23/06/2014
Following changes to the code required today:
	1. Change handling of boundary conditions to use surface type variable instead of sfElems array.
	2. Change the problem data input into multiple files instead of a single datafile.dat.
	3. Change the reading of data from the src folder to the data folder. Same for readmesh.
