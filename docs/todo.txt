File to add todos for Conduction FEM.

23/06/2014
Following changes to the code required today:
	1. Change handling of boundary conditions to use surface type variable instead of sfElems array.
	2. Change the problem data input into multiple files instead of a single datafile.dat.
	3. Change the reading of data from the src folder to the data folder. Same for readmesh.


- add another parameter to tetra-type
- in RayAbsorbing in rt_tracing count number of rays absorbed tetra%nrays = tetra%narys + 1
- set in rt_parameters
- use led setup
- emission from volume: choose random point, bring it to surface -> normal raytracing
- use data file from absorbtion as source for emission (needs some coding work)
