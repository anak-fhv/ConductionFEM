\section{Raytracing}

\subsection{Preliminary}
For forward Monte Carlo typically 2 methods are available, Collision-Based and Pathlength.
The former is simpler to implement, especially when considering scattering, the latter is more efficient (i.e. less rays are required).
So far Collision-Based will be implemented, however, Pathlength should be considered at a later stage.
The initial code should allow for analysis of LED problem and work with porous media analysis. 
The code should be modular, such that spectral-dependencies and various models for absorption and scattering can be easily implemented and used within the framework.
In the following each of the steps and its underlying equations, mostly the required cumulative distribution functions (CDF) necessary for the random number selection, are detailed.

\textbf{Assumptions for the mesh}: tetraeder elements

\subsection{Creating a Ray}
\textbf{Modul}: \textit{CreateRay} in \textit{rt$\_$tracing.f90} 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{select emission surface} \\
       In case several emission surfaces exist, one has to choose one for each ray. The selection will be based on a roulette-wheel selection dependent on the total area of the emission surface. In case the surfaces have different properties (e.g. temperature) the total black-body emissive power has to be used.\\
       \textbf{status}: too be implemented

 \item \textbf{select tetraeder for emission} \\
       The emission surface element contains the cumulative sum of the whole area for the emission surface normalized with the total area of the emission surface. Thus, a tetraeder (and hence the respective face on the surface) is chosen by a roulette wheel selection. This selection assumes that all elements have the same properties. If this is not the case, the selection has to consider the emissive power of each face.
       \textbf{status}: implemented for constant properties of the whole emission surface
 
 \item \textbf{select point within face for emission}
       Since all face are triangles the point of emission is chosen by the outcome of 2 uniformly distributed random numbers. At first, the longest side of the triangle is determined. This selects simultaneously a reference point and two directional vectors within the face. The first random number is the value of the CDF for the triangle distribution. This value is used to find a point on the longest side. The 2nd random number is the value for the CDF of a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution has the range $0$ to the height of the triangle at the first point selected. The corresponding direction is perpendicular to the direction of the longest side.
       \textbf{status}: implemented, maybe replaced by an approach relying on the shape functions
       
 \item \textbf{select direction of emission}
       The direction of the emitted ray is depends on 2 angles, $\Theta$ and $\Psi$. The general equations are given in \cite[p.~653f.]{Mod03}. 
       \begin{align}
        R_\Psi & = \dfrac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\Psi \int_0^{\pi/2} \dfrac{\epsilon^\prime_\lambda}{\epsilon_\lambda} \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d} \Theta \mathrm{d} \Psi \\
        R_\Theta & = \dfrac{\int_0^\Theta \epsilon^\prime_\lambda \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d} \Theta}{\int_0^{\pi/2} \epsilon^\prime_\lambda \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d} \Theta} 
       \end{align}
       In case the surface is isotropic, 
       \begin{equation}
        \epsilon_\lambda = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \epsilon^\prime_\lambda \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d}\Theta
       \end{equation}
       yields for a diffuse emitter
       \begin{align}
        R_\Psi & = \dfrac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^\Psi \mathrm{d} \Psi = \dfrac{\Psi}{2 \pi} \\
        R_\Theta & = \dfrac{\int_0^\Theta \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d} \Theta}{\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos \Theta \sin \Theta \mathrm{d} \Theta} = \dfrac{2}{1} \dfrac{\sin^2 \Theta}{2} = \sin^2 \Theta
       \end{align}
       Choosing the values $R_\Psi$ and $R_\Theta$ zuniform randomly, allows to determine the corresponding angles $\Psi$ and $\Theta$. Note, the range of the polar angle $\Theta$ is $0 \le \Theta \le \pi/2$, meaning only direction inside the tetraeder from the face are allowed. Starting with normal vector of the emission face (see previous point), first the direction of the normal vector is verified to point inward the tetraeder. Then the normal vector (normalized!) is rotated with $\Theta$ about a normalized vector within the face as rotation axis. Next, the resulting vector is rotated with $\Psi$ with the normal vector as rotation axis.
